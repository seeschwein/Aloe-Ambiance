Nokia Belle FP2 theme
Hello. This is an early project to port Jolla UI to Nokia Symbian Belle. I experimented with the light texture layer by arraying triangles, but performance was low due to the complex element. A .png graphic was generated to serve as background.
It contains official icons from Sailfish OS UI guidelines.
Feel free to compile the theme, modify and redistribute it.
