Nokia Belle FP2 theme

Hello. This is an early project to port Jolla UI to Nokia Symbian Belle using the native theming system. I experimented with the light texture layer by arraying triangles, but performance was low due to the complex element. A .png graphic was generated to serve as background.

It contains official icons from Sailfish OS UI guidelines.

Feel free to compile the theme, modify and redistribute it.

I don't develop this anymore.
