Nokia Belle FP2 theme

Hello. This is an early project to port Jolla UI to Nokia Symbian Belle using the native theming system. I experimented with the light texture layer by arraying triangles, but performance was low due to the complex element. A .png graphic was generated to serve as background.

It contains official icons from Sailfish OS UI guidelines.

Feel free to compile the theme, modify and redistribute it. Help yourself with the third party icons database - it was originally generated by ItalianLabs' plugin for Belle and has my additions.

I don't develop this anymore.
